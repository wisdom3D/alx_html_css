        <h1>HTML project</h1>
        <p> my first parametre <br> At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied 
            to pieces of text to give them different meaning
             in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a 
             document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?),
              and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these 
            and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines
            the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used
            to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website 
            or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
            and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
        </p>
        <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>
        <p> An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name 
            surrounded by "" and "". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be 
            written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the tag can be written as , 
            , or in any other way. However, the convention 
            and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>
        <h3>HTML forms</h3>
        <p> Forms are a very important part of the Web â€” these provide much of the 
            functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g. registering 
            and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets 
            you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.</p>
